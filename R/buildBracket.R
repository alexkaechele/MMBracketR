# Bracket builder


# Determine best picks for bracket
# 1. Allow seed multiplier
# 2. Allow rd weights eg c(1,2,4,8,16,32)
# 3. Upset condition (predict upset if lower seed is greater than x%) (overwritten if seedMult = TRUE)
# 4. Forward vs backward method? (start with champ or round 1)
buildBracket <- function(teams, weights = c(1,2,4,8,16,32), seedMult = FALSE, upsetThresh = .5, verbose=FALSE){
  
  
  
  
  
  # Give bracket
  return(teams)
}
